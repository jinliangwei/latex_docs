\section{Process Storage}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Process Storage Basics}
\begin{itemize}
\item ProcessStorage caches a set of rows. Caching means that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The storage does not necessarily contains the row that its clients ask for;
\item Resident rows may get evicted anytime unless it's properly protected by 
reference counting. 
\end{enumerate}

\item ProcessStorage provides the following interface (implementation details 
  later):

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Find()}: Intialize the accessor to point to the row specified by 
  the row index. 
\item \texttt{Insert()}: Insert a client row (including metadata). Optionally 
returns the evicted row and provide an accessor to the inserted row.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Major Data Structures}
\begin{itemize}
\item Concurrent Cuckoo hash: support concurrent insert, look-up and delete; 
support dynamic resizing; does not support concurrent traversal. The hash table
maps row index to client row pointer.
\item Striped lock: each lock guards a disjoint subset of row indices. A lock 
protects the validity of client row pointers stored in the hash table.
\item An integer to denote the number of occupied slots in the hash table.
\item CLOCK LRU logic, which contains the following data structures (bitsets and
 array are sized to capacity):
\begin{itemize}
\item A bitset of recency bits: each bit denotes if a row is recently accessed;
\item A bitset of occupation bits: each bit denotes if a slot is occupied by a row;
\item An array of integers mapping slot to row index. This is needed when 
finding a row to evict. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Semantics of the Striped Lock}
\begin{itemize}
\item The striped lock is shared between ProcessStorage and its component CLOCK 
LRU.
\item Since a lock guards the validity of client row pointers stored in the hash
  table, the lock should be acquired when
\begin{enumerate}
\item The operation might invalidate the row pointer (e.g. erasing the row from 
  the hash table);
\item Or the operation requires the validity of the row but cannot guarantee that
via other means (e.g. reference counting).
\end{enumerate}
\item As shown later, this should be the only cases where lock is necessary.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{CLOCK LRU High Level Idea}
\begin{itemize}
\item The ProcessStorage employs CLOCK LRU as a manager for eviction. The eviction makes 
assumption about ProcessStorage and provides certain guarantees.
\item The LRU logic keeps track of number $C$ rows, where $C$ is the cache capacity. We
refer to such space as LRU slots for rows. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{CLOCK LRU Interface}
The CLOCK LRU logic shares access to the striped lock and the hash table, and 
provides the following APIs:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Evict()}: pick a row and erase it from the hash table. 
  It guarantees to not evict a row that has non-zero reference count. It might
  be stuck in an infinite loop or return failure if all resident rows have non-zero
  reference count. The eviction respects the sematics of the striped lock. Once
  succeed, the number of occupied LRU slots is decremented by 1.
\item \texttt{Insert()}: notify the LRU logic that a row is resident in the 
  hash table. A row cannot become a cadidate for eviction until \texttt{Insert()}
  is invoked. Once succeed, the number of occupied LRU slots is incremented by 1.
  It does not access striped lock.
\item \texttt{Reference()}: notify the LRU logic that a row is recently accessed.
LRU takes this a hint. It does not access striped lock.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{CLOCK LRU Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Insert()} is invoked only if the number of occupied slots plus the 
  number of concurrent Insert() is strictly below cache capacity.
\item \texttt{Evict()} is invoked only if the numer of occupied slots minus the 
  number of concurrent Evict() is strictly larger than 0.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Regarding Occupation Bits}
\begin{itemize}
\item The occupation bits are concerned about two operations: insert and evict.
\item Eviction cannot happen to an empty slot and insertion cannot happen to an 
occupied slot.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

Details on LRU and ProcessStorage implementation will follow.

\section{Grouped Reference Count}

\begin{frame}
Grouped Reference Count
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Main Idea}

Store reference count outside of row object (possibly in LRU cache) to allow 
double-checked locking when access a resident row.
